# Implementation

## Blueprints

### Adding the interface

For an actor to have a faction, we need to add a FactionAgentInterface.
This will allow the system to set and get the current interface.

To add an interface we have to go into **Class Settings**

From here we click on **Add**, inside Interfaces and search for FactionAgentInterface

### Getting and Settings the Faction

Factions require your actor to define how to get and set a faction. That can be done overriding **GetFaction** and **SetFaction**.

A common implementation would be to have a **variable** (of type *"Faction"*), and then return it with GetFaction and set it with SetFaction:

### Factions in Controllers

Sometimes you may want a controller to share a faction with its controlled pawn or character.

This process is exactly the same as before, except that instead of getting and setting a variable, we will get and set the faction from our pawn.
